#Styleguide

##Spelling
 * We use [Oxford Spelling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling) (`~ize` not `~ise`), but note the [irregularities list](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ize-ise-or-yse). A further useful resource may be the [Ubuntu Word Substitution list](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/EnglishTranslation/WordSubstitution);
 * We do not censor *taboo* words &#8211; we all know what the words are;
 * We have a preference for `~t` not `~ed` past participates; learnt, not learned (unless we mean *learnèd*);
 * blonde (fem.); blond (masc.).

## Punctuation
 * We do not underline.
 * For lists, a semi-colon (`;`) denotes the end of a list item, with the final item in the list having a period (`.`);
 * One space follows a period, not two or more;
 * Numbers under 10 are spelt; numbers over ten are numerically given;
 * List items start with an upper-case letter;
 * A preference is expressed for ligatures and accented letters to aid reading: `hæmatology`, `naïf` etc.;
 * Abbreviations have a denoting period;
 * We use emdashes (&#8212;) and endashes (&#8211;). If in doubt, refer to [Butterick](http://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html); 
 * Ellipses are executed as one character (`…`), not three individual periods.
