_Emergency Response Protocol:_

**Health Outbreak**

_ **Any health related outbreak – flu, mass food poisoning, swarm of insects, etc. with multiple casualties, or risk thereof.** _

- Focus on provision of information and containment.
- Defer to Red Cross on all medical decisions, verdicts and directives.
- If MSL or SL are themselves affected by the outbreak, next available sober Leads should be found to take their places.
- If there is serious hazard or health risk, no-mads and everyone else stays clear. Medical will call in appropriate support from surrounding hospitals.
- In case of death due to a health outbreak - follow protocols for 'Death on Site'
- Privacy of all individuals involved in the incident is to be respected at all times, and the spread of rumours should be contained – all team members to actively assist in this!
