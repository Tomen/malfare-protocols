# **Nowhere Eviction Process:**

- The following 3 people are needed to effect an eviction:
   - Malfare Shift Lead ("MSL")
   - Board Lead ("BL")
   - 1 Site Lead ("SL")

- Must have involvement of all three of the above to effect and
    eviction.

- No one else is involved in eviction decisions. 

- None of the above individuals may be related to or close personal
    friends of the potential evictee, as this would constitute a
    conflict of interest.

- If the Board or Site Lead has a conflict of interests, an
    alternative, sober Board Member or Lead must be found.

- Tea & Empathy (T&E) Lead may step in for MSL if the latter has
    personal ties to the potential evictee.

## Roles

 - MSL/T&E Lead &endash; represent the health and safety interests of
     the potential evictee;
 - SL/Board Lead &endash; represent the interests of the event.

## When can someone be evicted?

 - For (suspected) criminal behaviour (theft, physical assault, sexual
    assault, rape);
 - For harmful or threatening behaviour toward other participants
    (preferably after receiving at least 1 warning if situation allows
    it).
 - Only if ALL 3 agree on eviction.

##Â Rules to follow
 - Eviction decisions are made behind closed doors, away from the
    general public;
 - Eviction decisions are made only by MSL, BL and SL (or their
     designated fill-ins, as outlined above), and only in unanimous
     agreement; 
 - If there is no agreement, an alternative solution needs
    to be found; 
 - The safety and welfare of the evictee should not be
    compromised by their eviction.

## Possible alternative solutions to immediate eviction
 - the potential evictee sobers up at T&E or Malfare before eviction;
 - the potential evictee stays at Malfare, under supervision, until
    morning when transportation and other services resume;
 - the potential evictee promises to avoid further confrontation /
    disruptive behaviour or else they will be evicted with no further
    questions or discussions;
 - friends take responsibility for the individual with the
     understanding that if the problem continues the individual will be
    evicted with no further questions or discussions;
 - the potential evictee agrees to move their tent to another area of
     the site to avoid confrontation / creating further problems;
 - a compromise is reached which the potential evictee and any others
     involved agree on.
  - these alternative solutions are to be used only if:
    1. The individual is not sober or well enough to leave site right
       then on their own;
    1. There is no further danger to any other participants on site.

**NOTE: in cases where a participant is out of control, volatile and
poses an immediate threat to themselves or others around them, law
enforcement must be called.**
