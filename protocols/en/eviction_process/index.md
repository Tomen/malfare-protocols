# **Nowhere Eviction Process:**

- The following people are needed to effect an eviction:
   - Malfare Shift Lead ("MSL")
   - Site Lead(s) ("SL")
   - 007 operative

- All must be involvement to effect an eviction.
- No one else is to involved in eviction decisions, save those defined under the [007 protocol](../007/). 
- None of the above individuals may be related to or close personal friends of the potential evictee, as this would constitute a conflict of interest.
- If the 007 operative or a Site Lead has a conflict of interests, an alternative, sober must be found.
- The Malfare Lead may step in for MSL if the latter has personal ties to the potential evictee.

## Roles

- **Malfare (Shift) Lead** — represents the health and safety interests of the potential evictee and others;
- **Site Leads** — represents the interests of the event;
- 007 represents both, as well as the community.


## NOTE WELL

**In cases where a participant is out of control, volatile, and/or poses an immediate threat to themselves or others around them, security and Red Cross must be involved at the earliest opportunity, and if necessary, police called.**


## When can someone be evicted?

- For suspected serious criminal behaviour (theft, physical assault, sexual assault, rape, arson);
- For harmful, intimidating, or threatening behaviour toward other participants (preferably after receiving at least 1 warning if situation allows it).
- Only if ALL agree on eviction.


## Rules to follow

- Eviction decisions are made behind closed doors, away from the general public;
- Eviction decisions are made only by those listed above (or their designated fill-ins, as outlined above), and only in unanimous agreement;
- If there is no agreement, an alternative solution needs to be found.


## Possible alternative solutions to immediate eviction

- the potential evictee sobers up at Welfare Enough or Malfare before eviction;
- the potential evictee stays at Malfare, under supervision, until morning when transportation and other services resume;
- the potential evictee promises to avoid further confrontation / disruptive behaviour or else they will be evicted with no further questions or discussions;
- friends take responsibility for the individual with the understanding that if the problem continues the individual will be evicted with no further questions or discussions;
- the potential evictee agrees to move their tent to another area of the site to avoid confrontation / creating further problems;
- a compromise is reached which the potential evictee and any others involved agree on.
- these alternative solutions are to be used only if:
   1. The individual is not sober or well enough to leave site right then on their own and medical intervention by Red Cross is not an option;
   1. There is no further danger to any other participants on site.
