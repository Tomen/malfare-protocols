# Evacuation Procedure

## Fires

The goal of any fire procedure is to:

 - Call for help
 - Move people away
 - Move fuel away
 - Extinguish the fire

In every case Nowhere Site Lead will call the local fire department

 - **Emergency 112**
 - Sari&ntilde;ena 974-571-070
 - Huesca 974-220-000

Based on below process, a perimeter will be established to protect
people from the fire and this perimeter will be grown as needed up to
and including a full site evacuation

Items which are considered fuel should be moved away / out of the path
of a potential fire including moving vehicles and potentially
flammable / combustible objects out of the way but.

Do not in any circumstances obstruct &mdash; even temporarily &mdash;
the access route/road/path.

### Types of threat
There are two fire event types that will cause which would cause a
rapid evacuation of the site.

 1. If a fire is *onsite*
 1. If a fire if *offsite* &ndash; but threatens the event

#### Onsite fire
For the first case ( *onsite* ), the immediate actions for all
on-duty staff our covered in the _Emergency Response Protocol : Fire
Emergency - Onsite_.


#### Off-site fires
The immediate actions for all on-duty staff our covered in the
_Emergency Response Protocol : Fire Emergency - Offsite_.

## Evacuation

 - An evacuation of the site is to proceed if the fire cannot be contained, in the view of any one (or more of)
   - Malfare Lead (year-round)
   - Malfare Shift Lead
   - Either/both on-duty Site Lead(s)
   - 007 operative

 - Once a decision to evacuate has been made, The Malfare Shift Lead will be in charge of evacuation and may deviate from the protocols as event unfolds

 - The choice to halt the evacuation **MUST** have &#8532; consensus
 from 
   - Malfare Shift Lead
   - One Site Lead
   - 007 operative

 - The evacuation point will be staffed by one site lead.
 - The other site lead will take a map and assign Nomads and all hands to sweep the site from the
 outside in: if using the assembly point.
 - All those with radios should switch to ear pieces
 - Other Responsible (sober) Personnel may be approached with URGENCY
 to assist, and placed on comms as needed.

## Get Attention

The first step in the Evacuation will be to get the attention of all
participants. 3 Actions will be taken.

1. **Malfare will sound the sirens**, and if needed, use a Megaphone to get attention.
<br />
> "ALL COMM, ALL COMM. This is KHAKI. A site-wide evacuation will take
> place. Repeat. A site-wide evacuation will take place. RADIO PRIORITY IS
> DECLARED. NO FURTHER RADIO COMMUNICATIONS WITHOUT KHAKI'S CLEARANCE.
>
> All people carrying radios proceed IMMEDIATELY to the Malfare complex."

2. **Sound Systems** are to immediately stop playing (but should remain on in case of need).

## Move
 - Site Lead 1 to Assembly point
 - Site Lead 2 to Malfare marquee to divide people
 - MSL to Malfare marquee to quickly brief
 - Designated driver to Malfare
 - Interpreters to Malfare
 - On-duty power team to proceed to Malfare

## Meeting Points

 - **MSL** may re-allocate people to ensure site-wide coverage.
 - A site vehicle shall be loaded with supplies and driven to the assembly point. The RECEIVER shall go in this vehicle, to prepare for in-bound EVACUEES.
 - **DISABLED PEOPLE** shall be collected and taken to the EVACUATION POINT. Own vehicles may be used for these purposes
 - **RED CROSS** shall decide on the condition of those in their care to transport themselves, or if they need site vehicle/ambulance transport.
 - **ADDLED PARTICIPANTS** should be escorted by friends or in their absence by those prepared to use strength and persuasion to get them off the site.
 - **BARRIO LEADS** shall ensure their camp mates are all accounted for, especially within tents.
 - **PARENTS** shall be responsible for their children.

## Site sweep
 - All designated people to radio in "[ALPHA-ZULU] [ONE]: SWEPT. NO
 ISSUE/ISSUE", where ALPHA-ZULU ONE is their given zone; Site Lead 2 to tick off

## EVACUATE!!

- All personnel shall proceed to the designated evacuation point as directed by the MSL, via the designated routes.
- People before property.

## At the Evacuation Point

 - Ask if anyone is known to be missing?
 - Responsible persons for each area reporting in.


## Return to site

 - Once the threat has been neutralized/contained, and in the view of MSL and the on duty leadership team, and if applicable, officials from the municipality and elsewhere, it is safe to return to the site, a site visit shall happen.

 - Gate shall be re-established, and extra volunteers enlisted before others are
 allowed back.

 - When satisfied, people will be free to return to the site in an orderly fashion.


## Shift Turn Over

If a fire happens at shift-change DO NOT STAND DOWN. Continue until stood down by MSL or Malfare Lead. The oncoming team will support (and not replace) the on staff roles.
