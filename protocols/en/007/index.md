## Objective

This protocol sets out the approach we take for responding to circumstances where we may evicting a person (or multiple people) from Nowhere; instigate restraint; or request medical assistance, at all stages of the event: during build, during the event, during take-down, and applies when the quorum (as defined above) is met (by bodies on site).

At other times, the executive member and one other community elder's decision is needed to exclude a person.

## Automatic triggers

The protocol is automatically triggered (and the duty of all on-shift seniors to enforce, but especially the Malfare Shift Lead's) under these circumstances

 * When one (or more) participant or incident consumes greater than five hours of any on-duty person's time (including when said person is off-rota);
 * When attention is brought to Malfare, of a participant who may be vulnerable (in the views of either laymen, or appropriately qualified professionals);
 * Situations when greater than 100 participants from beginning to end of the festival are exhibiting common symptoms (see also: [health outbreak protocol](/en/health-outbreak))
 * When a theft, sexual assault, negligence, carelessness incident is reported;
 * When a serious crime is reported to Malfare or a on-duty lead;
 * Breach of the fire regulations;
 * Third substantiated / actioned noise complaints for individuals, camps, installations &c;
 * Actions & incidents that jeopardize the future of the event;
 * Continual risks to self;
 * Continual risks to others;
 * Reports of menacing and/or predatory behaviours.
 
## Manual triggers

Under these circumstances, this protocol may be brought into action:

 * At the discretion of one of the on-duty leadership team;
 * At the discretion of the Malfare Lead(s);
 * At the request of a director;
 * At the request of Red Cross, or the licensed contracted security team

## 007 selection criteria 

Malfare Leads will, on behalf of the community, select from those who've purchased tickets, and are known to be coming, between 10 and 25 people in good standing, to act on behalf of the community, to make decisions, on-site about [certain events](#powers).

The list of 007 Operatives will be published via the rota, exist as a shared document on Google Drive, as well as printed and displayed within the Malfare cabin.

### 007 operatives willâ€¦

 * Be in-good standing with the community;
 * Be indemnified for their actions whilst on duty, by Nowhere (Europe) Ltd.;
 * Be experienced (three or more years) participants;
 * Have served as a lead in the past for greater than three years;
 * Be as objective as possible, without being emotional;
 * Put aside religious, conscientious, and personal ethical views whilst on-duty;
 * Have demonstrated, at Nowhere, the able to quickly form rational, logical, evidence-based decisions objectively, putting the longer-term needs of the event, ahead of anything else;
 * Need to recuse themselves if they are involved in situations;
 * Act in good faith;
 * Be loosely representative (collectively) of the Nowhere community;
 * Be empowered by the community, to act on behalf of the community;
 * Be able to self-nominate themselves, if they feel they meet these criteria subject to the timelines published by Malfare from time to time;
 * need to make decisions that are equitable for participants and the event.

## Conflict of interest & emotional triggers

Should there be a conflict of interest or emotional triggers, from any person involved, they should immediately recuse themselves from the process, and an alternative person shall be found to exercise such duties.

## Actions

### Evictions
If it's felt that a person needs to be evicted from the event, the convened members will decide.

All members must be in agreement for an eviction to take place.

### Calling the police
Various events per our protocols already stipulate calling the police: this protocol does not change that. In some situations, it may be the judgement call of the convened members to request that the police assist us.

Unanimous agreement should be sought, but if agreement can't be reached within an hour of the meeting starting, a two-thirds or above majority may prevail.

### Requesting medical attention or interaction
Unanimous agreement should be sought, but if agreement can't be reached within an hour of the meeting starting, a two-thirds or above majority may prevail.

### Authorising use of restraint
Unanimous agreement should be sought, but if agreement can't be reached within an hour of the meeting starting, a two-thirds or above majority may prevail.
