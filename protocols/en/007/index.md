## Objective

This protocol sets out the approach we take for evicting a person (or multiple people) from Nowhere, at all stages of the event: during build, during the event, during take-down, and applies when the quorum (as defined above) is met (by bodies on site).

At other times, the executive member and one other community elder's decision is needed to exclude a person.


## Automatic triggers
The protocol is automatically triggered (and the duty of all on-shift seniors to enforce, but especially the Malfare Shift Lead's) under these circumstances

 * When one (or more) participant or incident consumes greater than five hours of any on-duty person's time;
 * When attention is brought to Malfare, of a participant who may be vulnerable (in the views of either laymen, or appropriately qualified professionals);
 * Situations when greater than 100 participants from beginning to end of the festival are exhibiting common symptoms (see also: [health outbreak protocol](/en/health-outbreak))
 * When a theft, sexual assault, negligence, carelessness incident is reported;
 * When a serious crime is reported to Malfare or a on-duty lead;
 * Breach of the fire regulations;
 * Third substantiated / actioned noise complaints for individuals, camps, installations &c;
 * Actions & incidents that jeopardize the future of the event;
 * Continual risks to self;
 * Continual risks to others;
 * Reports of menacing and/or predatory behaviours.
 
## Manual triggers

Under these circumstances, this protocol may be brought into action:

 * At the discretion of one of the on-duty leadership team;
 * At the discretion of one of the sober Malfare Leads;
 * At the request by a director;
 * At the request of Red Cross or the licensed Security team

Malfare Leads will, on behalf of the community, select from those who've purchased tickets, and are known to be coming, 10 people in good standing, to act on behalf of the community, to make decisions, on-site about [certain events](#powers).

The full list will only be known by the Malfare leads, although the on-duty person for any given time will be stored in a sealed envelope (with the date and time on the outside) in the Malfare Cabin, for use in situations where a meeting is needed.
