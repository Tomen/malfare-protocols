## Introduction

## Guidelines for Radio Use

### Definitions
| Term             | Meaning |
|---               |---      |
|Procedure Word    | A word or phrase that carries a specific meaning when used on the radio â€” see [Procedure Words](#procedure-words) for details.     |

### The Basics

- When initiating a call, remember the following:
    - **Think** about what you're going to say.
    - **Check** that you are on the correct channel.
        - See the [Channel List](#channel-list) for more information.
    - **Listen** to the radio before you transmit.
        - If the channel is busy and you have *critical traffic* to transmit, consider using the [procedure word](#procedure-words) `break break break`
    - **Push** the large push-to-talk button the side of your radio.
    - **Pause** for one second.
    - **Speak** briefly and clearly.
    - **Release** the push-to-talk button.
- **Don't** use operational event-time channels for social use.
- **Don't** use names on the radio.
    - Bad Examples:

    > "Sandy, Sandy, Sandy, come in for Bob"

    > "James has tripped and hurt his knee"

    - Good Examples:

    > "Malfare, Malfare, Malfare, come in for Gate"

    > "A participant requires medical assistance with a knee injury"

- **Don't** use the terms `affirmative` or `negative`.
    - These terms can be confused with each other if the start of your transmission is missed.
    - Use `yes yes` and `no no` instead.

## Procedure Words
The following is a list of recognized *procedure words* that are in use at Nowhere.

|Term   | Meaning  |
| ------------------   |   ---    |
| `All-Com` | This transmission is for everyone on this channel. Generally repeated twice.
| `Break Break Break` | Stop talking on this channel, the message I have to deliver is of higher importance. *Make sure the message you have is definitely more important when using this.* |
| `Cancel Cancel` | The request being made is not longer required. The word is repeated to be clear an unambiguous. |
