## Introduction

## Guidelines for Radio Use

### Definitions

| Term             | Meaning |
|---               |---      |
|Procedure Word    | A word or phrase that carries a specific meaning when used on the radio — see [Procedure Words](#procedure-words) for details.     |

### The Basics

- When initiating a call, remember the following:
    - **Think** about what you're going to say.
    - **Check** that you are on the correct channel.
        - See the [Channel List](#channel-list) for more information.
    - **Listen** to the radio before you transmit.
        - If the channel is busy and you have *critical traffic* to transmit, consider using the [procedure word](#procedure-words) `break break break`
    - **Push** the large push-to-talk button the side of your radio.
    - **Pause** for one second.
    - **Speak** briefly and clearly.
    - **Release** the push-to-talk button.
- **Do** be clear and concise.
- **Don't** use operational event-time channels for social use.
- **Don't** use profanity of any kind on operational event-time channels.
- **Don't** use names or personally identifiable information on the radio.
    - Bad Examples:

    > "Sandy, Sandy, Sandy, come in for Bob"

    > "Bob has tripped and hurt his knee"

    - Good Examples:

    > "Malfare, Malfare, Malfare, come in for Gate"

    > "A participant requires medical assistance with a suspected knee injury"

- **Don't** do the following over the radio:
    - Mention **Death** or **dead** — instead, call for medical assistance for a person who is *unconscious and not breathing*. Request a face-to-face with the malfare shift lead **now**. Refer to the death on site protocol for more information.
    - **Diagnose** a participant's condition — instead focus on what is needed (Malfare / Welfare / Red Cross), and describe symptoms and severity.
    - **Drugs**, "high", "overdose", "drunk" — again, *do not attempt to diagnose*. Instead describe a participant as "overly refreshed", "disorientated", "unresponsive" or "unconscious" as appropriate.
    - Mention **Sexual Assaults** or **Rapes**. See the Sexual Assault / Rape protocol for more information.
    - Discuss **Eviction** from site - this is face-to-face matter to be referred up to the malfare shift lead.

- **Don't** use the term `affirmative`.
    - These terms can be confused `negative` if the start of your transmission is missed.
    - Use `yes yes` instead.



## Procedure Words
The following is a list of recognized *procedure words* that are in use at Nowhere.

|Term   | Meaning  |
| ------------------   |   ---    |
| `All-Com` | This transmission is for everyone on this channel. Generally repeated twice.
| `Break Break Break` | Stop talking on this channel, the message I have to deliver is of higher importance. *Make sure the message you have is definitely more important when using this.* |
| `Cancel Cancel` | The request being made is not longer required. The word is repeated to be clear an unambiguous. |
| `Copy` /  `Copy That` | I have received and understood your message. |
| `Exercise Exercise` | This transmission is part of a drill or exercise and should not be interpreted as genuine. |
| `Fire Fire Fire` | Fire alert. This is followed by the location of the fire. |
| `No No` / `Negative` | A negative response. |
| `No Play` | (Used during a drill or exercise) This transmission is not part of the drill/exercise being run and must be taken as genuine. Typically repeated two to three times.
| `Now` | This is of **critical priority** and presents a risk to life or safety. If you are responding to this call *you are dropping everything and running*.|

| `Over` | I have finished transmitting and I await your response. |
| `Out`  | I have finished transmitting and no answer is required or expected. |
| `Radio Check` | I am testing that my radio works, please acknowledge receipt of this transmission. |
| `Priority Priority Priority` | Radio priority is being declared. All non-critical messages are to be held until priority has been lifted. **This is invoked by the malfare shift lead or assistant shift lead only.** |
