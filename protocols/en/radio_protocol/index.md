## Introduction

## Guidelines for Radio Use

### Definitions

| Term             | Meaning |
|---               |---      |
|Procedure Word    | A word or phrase that carries a specific meaning when used on the radio — see [Procedure Words](#procedure-words) for details.     |

### Basic Tips

- When initiating a call, remember the following:
    - **Think** about what you're going to say.
    - **Check** that you are on the correct channel.
        - See the [Channel List](#channel-list) for more information.
    - **Listen** to the radio before you transmit.
        - If the channel is busy and you have *critical traffic* to transmit, consider using the [procedure word](#procedure-words) `break break break`
    - **Push** the large push-to-talk button the side of your radio.
    - **Pause** for one second.
    - **Speak** briefly and clearly.
    - **Release** the push-to-talk button.


### Dos and Don'ts

- **Do** be clear and concise.

- **Don't** use operational event-time channels for social use.

- **Don't** use profanity of any kind on operational event-time channels.

- **Don't** use names or personally identifiable information on the radio.
    - Bad Examples:

    > "Sandy, Sandy, Sandy, come in for Bob"

    > "Bob has tripped and hurt his knee"

    - Good Examples:

    > "Malfare, Malfare, Malfare, come in for Gate"

    > "A participant requires medical assistance with a suspected knee injury"

- **Don't** do the following over the radio:
    - Mention **Death** or **dead** — instead, call for medical assistance for a person who is *unconscious and not breathing*. Request a face-to-face with the malfare shift lead **now**. Refer to the death on site protocol for more information.
    - **Diagnose** a participant's condition — instead focus on what is needed (Malfare / Welfare / Red Cross), and describe symptoms and severity.
    - **Drugs**, "high", "overdose", "drunk" — again, *do not attempt to diagnose*. Instead describe a participant as "overly refreshed", "disorientated", "unresponsive" or "unconscious" as appropriate. Focus on symptoms, not causes.
    - Mention **Sexual Assaults** or **Rapes** - call for a face-to-face with the malfare shift lead. See the Sexual Assault / Rape protocol for more information.
    - Discuss **Eviction** from site - call for a face-to-face with the malfare shift lead.

- **Don't** use the term `affirmative`.
    - These terms can be confused `negative` if the start of your transmission is missed.
    - Use `yes yes` instead.
