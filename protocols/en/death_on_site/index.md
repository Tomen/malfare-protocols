- If the identity of the individual can be established, an attempt must be made to locate any next of kin if they are at the event or anybody who may have been friends or campmates of the individual to inform them. This should not be done in public. Individuals should be asked to accompany you to T&E for an urgent matter. T&E (or best other suitable on-duty individual) will break the news and provide support.
