These instructions assume that you've previously translated, and have
a copy of the repository on your computer. If not, you'll need to

 - get a GitHub account
 - clone the repository

These are covered in the [general readme](index.html)

If you're all set, then:

 - update your local copy with the latest version: `git pull`

 - review the changes made since you last pulled. The easiest way to
 do this is look at the
 [changes](https://github.com/goingnowhere/malfare-protocols/commits/gh-pages)

 - changes to text will usually be marked out quite easily:
   - green lines are additions/replacements
   - red lines are deletions/original content
   - e.g. in
   [68e875a](https://github.com/goingnowhere/malfare-protocols/commit/68e875a6fb55c8297fcbc3f7cb49c37f84f0ee2a#diff-3d1113c29462b5307478c162b0686416L772) we replaced 'TRANS' with 'INTR' in the diagram)

  - Once you've made the updates in the translations, commit it, and
  make a Pull Request, so we can review and hopefully merge it in.
