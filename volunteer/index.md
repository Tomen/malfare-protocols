**From 2016, Malfare shifts are either six hours (Nomads, designated drivers, interpreters). Lead shifts are 8 hours plus up to an hour for handover**


## Our roles

 - [Nomads](#nomads)
 - [Designated driver](#designated-driver)
 - [Interpreter](#interpreter)
 - [Malfare Shift Lead](#malfare-shift-lead)
 - [Assistant Malfare Shift Lead](#assistant-malfare-shift-lead)

## <a name="nomads"></a>Nomads

Nomads are a cross-section of the Nowhere community who volunteer some of their time in the role of non-confrontational community mediators. Responding to the ever-changing environment, they address within our community situations that would otherwise require outside intervention. By encouraging and facilitating communication, Nomads promote awareness of potential hazards, from sunstroke and thunderstorms to tent fires.

The most important qualification for being a Nomad is the desire to be an interactive participant. Helpful qualities include a sense of humour, flexibility, and a good pair of walking shoes.

Any technical skills a person may or may not have are secondary to a desire to help fellow citizens of Nowhere. Our training and mentoring are designed to help develop the skills that are needed at the event.

All prospective Nomads must be at least 18. Volunteering as a Nomad requires you to attend training prior to your shift starting and participating in an on site mentoring/evaluation shift prior to being accepted.

## <a name="designated-driver"></a>Designated driver

Do you have a driver's license and insurance? Want to help out Nowhere and be on-call for non-emergency transportation (we have the Red Cross for emergencies)? We provide the vehicles. If you've got a satnav unit/phone+signal, that's an added bonus.

Sometimes we need to run errands, or transport things around the site. We need someone sober, insured, and able to legally drive in Spain on call. That's this role. It may be a run to Zaragoza, a run to town, moving things around site, collecting people from the hospital.

Spanish speaking is an advantage in some cases, but where necessary, we'll do our best to find a Spanish speaker to assist you.

Shifts are 8 hours, and work on an on-call basis; you need to be receptive to your radio (we'll provide this!) whilst on-shift, and sober and safe to drive; possibly with passengers.

## <a name="interpreter"></a>Interpreter

Interpreters support Malfare leads and participants by translating from Spanish into English. This could be with the municipality (who give us our license), the Red Cross, the police, the clinics and hospitals, the pharmacy, and other merchants in town.

## <a name="malfare-shift-lead"></a>Malfare Shift Lead

Take responsibility for everyone on site. Yeap, that's the role of the Malfare Shift Lead. 

For eight hours, you'll be responsible for everyone. As you might guess, we want to make sure you're prepared for this, so in order to do this, you'll need to have previously done a Malfare Shift Lead, been an Assistant Malfare Shift Lead, or do something that has the skills we need from you in the real-world.

Training's provided for this role, expanding on the Nomad training. You'll also need familiarity with the community, protocols, and procedures for Nowhere.

## <a name="assistant-malfare-shift-lead"></a>Assistant Malfare Shift Lead

Support the Malfare Shift Lead, and get prepared for doing the role yourself! A step-up from the Nomads, this role's really about shadowing an experienced Malfare Shift Lead, and learning the ropes, so you can see if this role is something you want to do.
